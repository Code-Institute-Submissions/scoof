				<button class="accordion">Is cafetiere the same as a French Press / Coffee Press / Plunger Pot?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Cafetiere is a common name for a type of coffee preparation method where ground coffee is infused in a tall pot and the grounds separated from the hot water using a circular mesh plunger. Cafetieres are called a range of different names around the world including; French Press, Coffee Plunger, Plunger Pot, Cafetiere a Piston, Coffee maker, Koffiekan, Kaffeebereiter, Caffettiera...</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion">How do I know that Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup>will fit my cafetiere?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>There are 3 sizes of cafetiere and currently one size of Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> (more to come soon!). Cafetiere sizes are generally measured in small espresso cup sizes. Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> is designed to fit standard 8 cup cafetieres (1 litre or 35.2 fl oz). Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> has a diameter of 8.4cm is designed to be slightly smaller than the plunger diameter to ensure a good fit (generally 8.5cm+). Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> also fits most 4 and 6 cup cafetieres which have a similar plunger diameter. Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> may be used in a 12 cup cafetiere, although it will be less efficient as the plunger diameter is generally 10cm. Scoof <sup>&reg;</sup> will not fit smaller 3 cup cafetiere sizes (plunger diameter of 6cm+).</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion">Do you make a larger Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> for when I want to brew a 12 cup cafetiere of coffee?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>We don’t currently make a larger Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup>. But the current standard size Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> will fit a 12 cup cafetiere and can be used as a dedicated cleaning tool.</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion">Do you make a smaller Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> for when I want to brew a 3 cup cafetiere of coffee?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>We don’t currently make a smaller Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> and a standard size scoof will not fit a 3-cup cafetiere. We plan to offer a smaller Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> soon!</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion">Can I compost used coffee grounds?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Yes. Once you have made the coffee, the grounds are rinsed, and the leftover coffee grounds contain a good amount of the essential nutrient nitrogen as well as some potassium and phosphorus, plus other micronutrients.</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion">Can I damage my Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> when putting it into hot coffee?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> is designed to withstand temperatures of boiling water, hot coffee is generally at a lower temperature. Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> should not be used as a general cooking utensil as pan heats may exceed 100oC.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">My Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> is becoming discoloured, what can I do to fix this?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Some people have solved this issue by simply putting the Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> through a dishwasher cycle.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">The waste coffee is slipping off the Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup>, how do I fix this?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>The Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> blades are designed to collect damp used coffee grounds after the cafetiere has been drained of excess coffee liquid.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">What is the Warranty on the Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup>?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> is warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from date of purchase from an authorized retailer. We advise you to keep your receipt so that if you have a problem with your Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> before one year has passed, you can prove when you purchased it and that you purchased it from an authorized retailer that sells genuine Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> cafetiere cleaners.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">What material do you use for Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup>?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>It is a food grade thermoplastic polymer called ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene).</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Does Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> contain BPA?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>No. Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> is free from BPA (bisphenol-A).</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Can I recycle Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup>?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Yes. At the end of its life Scoof<sup>&reg;</sup> can be recycled.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">What grind should I use?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Use a coarse grind to get the best results from a cafetiere.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Can I make a real espresso in a cafetiere?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>A true espresso is made with 9 bars of pressure and a cafetiere does not create this amount of pressure. If you use this definition then no, the cafetieres do not not make espresso. But if you define espresso by the taste of the drink in the cup, certainly a cafetiere can create a strong tasting coffee.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">How do I make a cappuccino?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>A cappuccino is made up of equal parts espresso, hot milk, and foamed milk. The traditional way of foaming and heating milk is with steam. But those who have tried battery powered stirrers agree that they do a great job of foaming milk and are very easy to use and clean.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">How do I make a latte?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>A latte is espresso mixed with hot milk. You can add hot milk to espresso style coffee or you can add cold milk and then heat the latte.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Can I brew tea in a cafetiere?</button>
					<div class="panel">
  						<p>Yes, simply add tea leaves to hot water in the cafetiere jar. Leave it to brew for a few minutes (according to taste). Then use the plunger to ‘strain’ the tea leave and stop the brewing process. Pour the tea as you would coffee!
