# Scoof

## Overview

### What is this app for?
 
This app is a website for the cafetiere cleaning tool Scoof, which has been designed by Joe Partridge. Scoof is new to the market.
 
### About the app?
 
This app will explain to users what Scoof is and how it works. The aim is to give the user a complete understanding of Scoof, it's benefits and how it may be useful to a coffee drinker using a cafetiere. 
 
### How does it work

The app uses html, css and javascript and is deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Features

The app displays rendered images of Scoof, instructions on how to use scoof and a video tutorial. There is an FAQ section aimed to answer many questions that a user may have and a contact form for any further information a user may require. Various generic social coffee related images are also shown to give a friendly feel to Scoof.

## Tech Used

html has been used to build the app.

css has been used to style the app.

javascript has been used for app interactivity.

Bootstrap has been used for the app framework to help give a simple responsive design. 

javascript testing has been performed manually. It was envisaged that jasmine would be used to test the javascript functionality. However it became apparent that the javascript code was not suited to this method of testing after numerous attempts. Therefore manual testing in the browser was performed to ensure the javascript is working as it should. Manual testing in the browser confirms that the javascript functionality works.

## Contributing
